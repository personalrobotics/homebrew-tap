Tapping
-------
Dependency and main source code formulae are available by adding this repository as a tap to your local homebrew installation:

    brew tap personalrobotics/tap

Untapping
---------
If you need to drop the tap due to compatability issues, or are very particular about keeping a clean homebrew installation, you can untap this repo:

    brew untap personalrobotics/tap

But note that you will not be able to upgrade any currently installed software from this tap.
